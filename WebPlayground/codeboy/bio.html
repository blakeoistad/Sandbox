        This is some placeholder text. Eventually I'll put an actual bio of some sort, detailing the things I care about, my motivations, things I enjoy, and whatever else I can think of that would be relevant information to put into a bio paragraph or two. You'll notice that this text is very long, but that's basically just so that I can get a good idea how this page will look with more than just a line or two of text. Anyway, I think this is probably sufficient for the time being. Later.
